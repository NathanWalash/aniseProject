# ðŸ“¬ Notifications System Plan

## **1. Overview**
The notifications system will allow users to receive, view, and manage important updates about their groups, payments, proposals, and reminders. The system will be designed to support real-time updates, marking as read, and future extensibility (e.g., push notifications).

## **2. Data Model & Structure**

### **Firestore Structure**
```
users/
  {userId}/
    notifications/
      {notificationId}/
        type: string         # e.g., 'invite', 'payment', 'proposal', 'reminder'
        message: string      # Notification text
        read: boolean        # Has the user read this notification?
        createdAt: timestamp # When was it created?
        link: string         # (optional) Deep link to relevant app screen
        groupId: string      # (optional) Related group ID
        groupName: string    # (optional) Related group name
        [other fields as needed]
```

### **Notification Document Example**
```json
{
  "type": "invite",
  "message": "You've been invited to join 'Green Investors' by Alice.",
  "read": false,
  "createdAt": "2024-06-01T12:34:56Z",
  "link": "/groups/green-investors",
  "groupId": "group_abc",
  "groupName": "Green Investors"
}
```

## **4. Roadmap**

### **Phase 1: UI Prototype (Hardcoded)**
- [ ] Build a notifications page that displays a list of hardcoded notifications.
- [ ] Design for unread/read states, icons, timestamps, and actions (e.g., mark as read).
- [ ] Implement empty state and loading state.

### **Phase 2: Firestore Integration**
- [ ] Set up Firestore structure as above.
- [ ] Fetch notifications for the current user from Firestore.
- [ ] Listen for real-time updates using Firestore's `onSnapshot`.
- [ ] Mark notifications as read in Firestore.

### **Phase 3: Backend/Cloud Functions**
- [ ] Write backend logic or Cloud Functions to create notifications on relevant events (invites, payments, proposals, etc.).
- [ ] Ensure notifications are written to the correct user's subcollection.

### **Phase 4: Advanced Features (Optional)**
- [ ] Add push notification support (FCM/APNs).
- [ ] Add notification preferences (user can mute certain types).
- [ ] Add batch/digest notifications (daily/weekly summary).
- [ ] Add swipe-to-delete/archive and filtering/grouping.

## **5. Implementation Notes**

- **For the prototype:**  
  You can use a hardcoded array of notification objects in your notifications page component.
- **For Firestore:**  
  Use a subcollection under each user for scalability and security.
- **For backend:**  
  Use Cloud Functions or your server to write notifications when events occur.
- **For real-time:**  
  Use Firestore's real-time listeners to update the UI instantly.

## **6. Example Notification Object (Frontend)**
```js
{
  id: 'notif_001',
  type: 'invite',
  message: 'You've been invited to join 'Green Investors' by Alice.',
  read: false,
  createdAt: '2024-06-01T12:34:56Z',
  link: '/groups/green-investors',
  groupId: 'group_abc',
  groupName: 'Green Investors'
}
```

---

## **Next Step**
**Start with a hardcoded notifications page** that matches the planned UI/UX.  
Later, swap in Firestore data and backend logic as the system matures.
